# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to connect to Google APIs to create interactive maps to assist a customer in planning out a vacation according to specific weather preferences.

## Relevant Folders Included in this Repository

### Weather_Database Folder
[Code](Weather_Database/Weather_Database.ipynb)  for randomly generating 2,000 random latitude and longitude coordinates, retrieving the nearest city, and gathering weather data about each. This dataframe is saved into a [CSV file](Weather_Database/WeatherPy_Database.csv).

### Vacation_Search Folder
[Code](Vacation_Search/Vacation_Search.ipynb) that accesses the CSV file created in the Weather_Database folder to allow filtering of cities by maximum and minimum desired temperatures as well as retrieving a nearby hotel for each, saved into another [CSV file](Vacation_Search/WeatherPy_vacation.csv).  This data is used to create a [map](Vacation_Search/WeatherPy_vacation_map.png) with markers at each filtered city with information for Hotel Name, City, Country, and Current Weather.

### Vacation_Itinerary Folder
Four cities were chosen within the same country to plot a possible vacation itinerary for the customer.  This [code](Vacation_Itinerary/Vacation_Itinerary.ipynb) plots these cities on a [map](Vacation_Itinerary/WeatherPy_travel_map.png) showing the driving route between them. Also included is the same [map](Vacation_Itinerary/MAPNAMEHERE.png) with markers that show Hotel Name, City, Country, and Current Weather.
